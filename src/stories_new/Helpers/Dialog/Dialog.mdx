# Dialog
## Message components for showing alerts.

<Meta of={Stories} />
<Canvas />
<Controls />

The signature of the helper functions are almost identical to their native counterparts.

The main differences are:
 1. They return a `Promise`. The `Promise` fulfils with the same values as the native functions.
 2. They accept an extra argument with a configuration object

Valid values for the configuration object are in the table above.


### Usage
<Source
  language='javascript'
  code={ dedent`
  import { Dialog } from '@kws3/ui';
  //---
  //alert example
  let alert_done = await Dialog.alert('This is an alert', {title: "someTitle"});
  //---
  //confirm example
  let accepted = await Dialog.confirm("Agree with everything?", {ok_button_text: "Yes", cancel_button_text: "No"})
  //---
  //prompt example
  let age = await Dialog.prompt("How old are you?");
  `}
